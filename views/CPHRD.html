                                The dynamic global economy demands constant changes in organizations to cope with the changes taking place across the globe. Organizations continuously make attempts to develop employees to cope with the changes because changes in employee skills, and abilities and attitudes are critical for organizational success. Organizations establish human resource development (HRD) departments and initiative various HRD activities to enhance their employed competencies and commitment.
