                            <p>
                                Consequent to decades of information technology deployment, organizations today have more information at hand than ever before. But in many cases the information is not being utilized to out-think the rivals. Thus organizations are missing out on a potent competitive tool.
                                <br>
                                Business Analytics is about quantitative analysis and predictive modeling towards data-driven competitive strategies. Exemplars of analytics are using tools to identify their most profitable customers; offer the right price; accelerate product innovation; optimize supply chains; identifying the true drivers of financial performance etc. Organizations as diverse as HSBC, PepsiCo, Amazon, Barclay's, Capital One, Procter &amp; Gamble, Wachovia, and the Boston Red Sox illuminate how to leverage the power of analytics. Competence in analytics has become a critical skill for managers of the new age business organisations.
