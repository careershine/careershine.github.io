                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>
                                Businesses across the globe are forced to address increasingly complex problems, adapt to rapid changes in technology, work across disciplines, produce more with limited resources and respond to almost continuous change through periodic reorganization and continuing innovation.
                                <br><br>
                                These demands have significantly increased the need for managers to think strategically and to work effectively in collaborative relationships - dyads, teams, and partnerships to realize their strategies.
                                <br><br>
                                The course aims to develop strategic thinking and implementation skills among managers who are already in or are going to be in general management roles. Thus, it aims to develop an appreciation of the concepts of corporate strategy. It also aims to develop an appreciation of the strategic issues facing an organization. Finally it also aims to develop leadership skills to steer successful strategy formulation and implementation.

                                This programme was earlier named as PLAM. It has been renamed as EPLM with the 6th batch.
