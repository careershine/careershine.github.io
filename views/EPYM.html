                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>
                                Young professionals graduating from professional programmes with specialization in areas such as engineering, medicine, pure sciences, commerce, etc., enter the workplace with little exposure to managerial concepts and skills. For them, the initial immersion into the complex world of practice can be challenging. After a period unwavering commitment and attention to the details of one’s work, the executive in search of excellence requires fresh insights and inputs. There arises a need for sharpening skills and strengthening the value of one’s experience with theoretical buttress.
                                <br><br>
                                Towards this end, EPYM aims to equip these professionals with the appropriate managerial know-how.  EPYM is designed to provide both perspective and managerial skills to successfully meet the challenges of today’s global business environment. The program provides an integrated overview of core business functions, key concepts, tools and techniques and enhances skills to provide a programme participant critical inputs required to do well in select functional areas. The program would enhance the participant's ability to face current and future challenges of management and business administration.
